# Write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.


=begin
========== THE PEDAC PROCESS ==========

=====> Problem:
Input: Given a triangle
        # An equilateral triangle has all three sides the same length.
        # An isosceles triangle has exactly two sides of the same length.
        # A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

Output: A string which says whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

=====> Rules
Explicit Requiremnts:
  - given length of the sides of the triangle as integers
  -
Implicit Requiremnts:
  - the sides of the triangle has to be greater than zero
  - 

=====> (Any Questions / Assumptions needing clarification?)
(e.g. return the same string object or an entirely new string???)
